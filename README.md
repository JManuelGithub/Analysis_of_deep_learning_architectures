# Analysis of Deep Learning Architectures for Fake Audio Detection

This repository contains the code used for the experiments presented in our article titled "Analysis of Deep Learning Architectures for Fake Audio Detection", currently under review (DOI: pending approval).

The implementation focuses on evaluating various deep learning architectures—including CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU, and hybrid CNN+LSTM, CNN+GRU models—for the task of classifying real and fake speech audio. Special emphasis is placed on balancing classification accuracy with computational efficiency.

### Dataset
The experiments were conducted using the Fake or Real (FoR) dataset, specifically the for-2seconds version, where each audio file is truncated and normalized to 2 seconds.

### Reference
Please cite the forthcoming article if you use this code in your research.
